## MINT program to interface with the TI SN76489 sound chip 
based on the Wikipedia article. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76489

##  Audio/visual effect generator 
- combining the SN76489 sound chip with an output display
- to create synchronized music and patterns!



This creates an extreme audiovisual demo that:

1. Generates synchronized sound and visuals:
   - Three tone channels modulated by visual patterns
   - Volume patterns synchronized with visual effects
   - Complex interference patterns create mesmerizing sounds

2. Creates two visual effects:
   - Plasma effect using interference patterns
   - Spinning tunnel effect using distance calculations
   
3. Pushes MINT to its limits:
   - Uses maximum screen resolution (32x16)
   - Complex math for visual effects
   - Precise timing for audio/visual sync
   - Nested loops for pattern generation
   - Real-time effect calculation

4. Key features:
   - Infinite loop with alternating effects
   - Time-based animation
   - Mathematical pattern generation
   - Multi-channel sound synthesis
   - Synchronized audio/visual patterns

`Audiovisual-mint`

To run it, simply execute:
```mint
> F
```

The program will generate:
1. A pulsing plasma pattern with synchronized three-channel music
2. A spinning tunnel effect with harmonized audio
3. Continuous alternation between effects

Each effect combines:
- Complex interference patterns
- Distance-based calculations
- Real-time mathematical transformations
- Multi-channel audio synthesis
- Synchronized modulation

This pushes MINT's capabilities in:
1. Mathematical computation
2. Display output
3. Sound generation
4. Real-time synchronization
5. Memory usage
6. Processing efficiency

It's a complete demoscene-style production in under 100 lines of MINT code! The result is a hypnotic combination of sight and sound that demonstrates the power of creative programming even with limited resources.
